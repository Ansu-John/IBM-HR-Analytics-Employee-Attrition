# Employee Attrition Analysis

# OBJECTIVE 
Employee attrition is the rate at which employees leave a company. The goal of this analysis is to model employee attrition and determine the most dominant contributing factors that govern this turnover. Through this kind of analysis, we can understand how many employees are likely to leave, while also determining which employees are at the highest risk and for what reasons.

Data Visulization for the same in Tableau can be seen in the [link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ansu.john#!/vizhome/EmployeeAttrition_16048425570390/EmployeeAttrition)

# DATASET USED

The dataset used in this analysis is provided from IBM HR to study about employee attrition, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).

# TOOLS

Python - Data modelling using LogisticRegression and  RandomForestClassifier, Data preprocessing using LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder

# TECHNIQUES

As I have already used [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ansu.john#!/vizhome/EmployeeAttrition_16048425570390/EmployeeAttrition) to analyse the data, I have only build data models to predict the employee attrition in this case study.
